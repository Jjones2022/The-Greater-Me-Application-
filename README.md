# The-Greater-Me-Application

## Problem Statement
Everyday we wake up, we have it in our mind that there is something I can do better today than yesterday. We always have the right intentions, but we never challenge ourselves to go the extra mile or take that extra step to do something we wouldn't normally do. This application will provide a solution to help change that way of thinking, by challenging the user to think differently in a way to progress their lives daily.

## Functionality
This application will allow the user to choose serveral things that may help their specific situation based on the information provided. The user will have the option to choose between mental health or physical health, and based on the choice a quote will also be generated that tends to the decision made by the user.
